1. â€‹There are two players.
2. The players take turns in the game.
3. In each turn, the player with the higher number wins, and their number becomes the new number to beat.
4. The game continues until one player wins k times consecutively.
   
1. Let's break down the code step by step:
2. int n = arr.length; - This line calculates the length of the input array arr and stores it in the variable n. This will be used to determine when the game should stop.

3. int i = 0, j = 1; - Two pointers i and j are initialized to 0 and 1, respectively. These pointers represent the indices of the elements in the array that the two players are currently using.

4. int count = 0; - The count variable is used to keep track of the consecutive wins of the current player.

5. int win = arr[0]; - The win variable is initialized to the first element of the array, which represents the current number to beat.

6. The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as both i and j are within the bounds of the array, i.e., i < n and j < n.

7. Inside the loop, it checks if the count has reached the value of k. If it has, that means a player has won k times consecutively, and the method returns the current winner, which is the element at index i.

8. If k has not been reached, it proceeds to compare the numbers at indices i and j in the array. If the number at index i is greater than the number at index j, player i wins the current round. In this case, j is incremented, and the win and count variables are updated accordingly.

9. If the number at index i is not greater than the number at index j, player j wins the round. In this case, i is set to j, and the win and count variables are updated for player j. Then, j is incremented.

10. The loop continues, and the process repeats until one player wins k times consecutively or the loop exits when either i or j goes out of bounds.

11. Finally, the method returns the winner, which is the element at index i (the last player to make a move).

**Intuition:**
The intuition behind this algorithm is to simulate the game while keeping track of consecutive wins. The code uses two pointers to represent the current players and updates the winner based on the rules of the game.

**Approach:**
The code uses a while loop to simulate the game and efficiently track the consecutive wins, ensuring that it stops as soon as one player wins k times.

**Complexity:**

Time Complexity: The time complexity of this code is O(n) in the worst case, where n is the length of the input array arr. This is because it iterates through the array once.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity is O(1) as the code uses a constant amount of extra space to store variables, regardless of the input size.
